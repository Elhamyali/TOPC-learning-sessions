# TOPC Learning Sessions 2023 Analysis and Insights
This notebook analyzes Zoom poll responses from four **learning sessions** for Cohort 3 in The Opportunity Project for Cities (TOPC) program 2023:

*   Systems mapping (data not available)
*   Data governance
*   User testing
*   Impact evaluation
*   Product launch

Every poll included questions to measure four **educational learning objectives** of adult critical thinking:

*   Knowledge and comprehension
*   Application
*   Analysis
*   Evaluation *(We excluded this objective because it was only measured in one learning session)*

This analysis includes these outputs:

*   **Summary statistics** for every learning session and educational learning objectives.
*   **Box plots** to visually represent the distribution of responses and their spread, providing insights into the overall confidence levels in each learning sessions and educational objectives.
